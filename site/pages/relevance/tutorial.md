The Relevance language forms the basis for most Bigfix content. It can be found in Computer Properties, and in Fixlets and Tasks. 

Computer Properties are just evaluations of a Relevance query. Whether or not Fixlet messages or Tasks appear relevant in the Bigfix 
Console is dictated by Relevance clauses, which are written in the BigFix Relevance Language. A Fixlet message may contain many 
relevance clauses, all of which must return True for it to become ***relevant*** for a certain computer. An expression will only 
lead to a Fixlet message becoming relevant if it successfully evaluates to True.

This quick tutorial introduces the most common Relevance features. Use the embedded online Relevance evaluator to practice writing 
Relevance queries. You can use the [QNA program](/tools/qna.html) or the [Online Evaluator](/relevance/evaluate/) as well 
to run your queries. The tutorial also guides you to navigate through other resources found in this website. 

After completing the tutorial, you should be able to read and write common Relevance queries, and make use of available resources 
to learn more advanced features.   

## Object Types

The Relevance Language is built upon a multitude of objects and their various properties. There are many types of objects (strings, 
integers, registry objects, versions, etc.), but sometimes it might be difficult to figure out which object type you have and which 
you need.  It is useful to think of the Relevance Language in terms of objects and properties. Most queries are properties of 
an object that produce another object.

The [Reference section](/relevance/reference/) lists down all available Relevance object types. 
Let's take {{'environment variable' | linkType}} for our example. As you can see under {{'environment variable' | linkType}} reference 
page, there are three sections: *Creation*, *Properties*, and *Casts*. Some other object types might have an additional section 
called *Operators*. 

The Creation section shows you all the ways you can produce an "environment variable" object. For example, you can run a query of the 
form:

````
variable <string> of <environment>
````

where the <{{'string' | linkType}}> is the name of the environment variable, and <{{'environment' | linkType}}> is the object 
corresponding to the environment. The following query returns you environment variable "PATH":

{% qna %}
Q: variable "PATH" of environment
A: PATH = /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
T: environment variable
{% endqna %}

You can also get a list of all your environment variables by typing:

{% qna %}
Q: variables of environment
A: HOME = /root
A: HOSTNAME = cdd0565da555
A: NODE_ENV = production
A: PATH = /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
A: PORT = 5002
T: environment variable
{% endqna %}

If you have doubts about how to create an {{'environment' | linkType}} object, you can look up the reference page 
for {{'environment' | linkType}} object, and look at the Creation section. As it turns out, you create an {{'environment' | linkType}} 
object by just writing "environment".

Notice the difference in plurality of `variable` between the two relevance clauses. Use the *singular form* when expect exactly one 
result, and use the *plural form* otherwise. See the guide on [Plurals](/relevance/guide/basics/singular-and-plural.html) for more details.

You can query the various properties of the `environment variable` object. To return the name or value of the environment variable, 
use the following commands respectively:

{% qna %}
Q: name of variable "PATH" of environment
A: PATH
T: string
{% endqna %}

{% qna %}
Q: value of variable "PATH" of environment
A: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
T: string
{% endqna %}

Some object types are converible to other object types by using the keyword `as`. This conversion is called *Casting*. For instance, 
you can cast an integer to string as follows:

{% evaluator %}
500 as string
{% endevaluator %}

Evaluate the query and notice that the returned type is "string" instead of "integer". You can find under a reference page's *Casts* 
section the list of the data types to which an object can be casted.

**Tip:** To quickly look up all the properties, use the [Inspector Search](/relevance/search/).

#### Practice with QNA

Using the reference pages of {{'rpmdatabase' | linkType}} and its properties, try to write a relevance that returns the version of the 
rpm package "libxml2".

{% evaluator %}

{% endevaluator %}

{% collapse "Show Answers" %}
versions of packages "libxml2" of rpm
{% endcollapse %}

**Tip:** You can also click **Ctrl-Enter** while typing the relevance to have it evaluated.

**Note:** Many data types do not have a representable text format. They would give your an error message about unrepresentable object, 
or operator "string" not defined. The relevance is still evaluated successfully in this case.

## Relevance in Fixlet

In Fixlet messages, Relevance expressions are used to determine whether the Fixlet is applicable to an endpoint. Thus the Relevance 
must return a Boolean value (either True or False). Although there are a few inspectors that return a Boolean value, there are two main 
ways to obtain a Boolean value: *existence* and *comparison*. You will use one of these tools in most relevance clauses.

### Existence

In its most basic form, a relevance expression can check for the existence of an object on the users' computer. Let's say that you want to 
write a Fixlet that must be relevant on all computers where a "hosts" file is located in the "/etc" folder. This is the query that you can run 
to evaluate the Fixlet relevance:

{% qna %}
Q: exists file "/etc/hosts"
A: True
T: boolean
{% endqna %}

The file "/etc/hosts" defines a {{'file' | linkType}} object. The result of the `exists` operator is a Boolean value. In this case, the 
query returns True if the file exists or False if it doesn't.  Therefore, a Fixlet message with the following relevance clause as 
applicability relevance, would cause all computers with the file "/etc/hosts" to report as relevant. 
You can also check for a folder using a similar syntax: 

{% qna %}
Q: exists folder "/var/tmp"
A: True
T: boolean
{% endqna %}

The guide page on the [Exists](/relevance/guide/basics/exists.html) keyword provides you with more usage examples.

#### Practice with QNA

Write a Relevance expression that returns True if the "/var/log" folder contains one or more files.

{% evaluator %}

{% endevaluator %}

{% collapse "Show Answers" %}
exists files of folder "/var/log"
{% endcollapse %}

### Comparison

The second basic form of a Relevance clause involves the comparison of two expressions. This is an example of this form that uses 
the equal sign as comparator:

{% qna %}
Q: number of processors = 1
A: True
T: boolean
{% endqna %}

The result of the query is True if both expressions are equal to each other, and False otherwise. Different object types have different 
comparison operators. In the above example, the "equal" sign compares an integer object, the result of the `number of processors` expression, 
to another integer. You can find the list of comparision operators for each object type under the "Operators" section of its reference page. 
For example, reference page for {{'version' | linkType}} shows that you can perform the following comparisions between a version object 
and another version object, or between a version object and a string: `<`, `<=`, `=`, `>=`, `>`.

#### Practice with QNA

Modify the previous relevance to compare the "libxml2" rpm version to "2.9.1". Your relevance should return True if the rpm version is 
higher than or equal to "2.9.1".

{% evaluator %}

{% endevaluator %}

{% collapse "Show Answers" %}
(version of package "libxml2" of rpm) >= "2.9.1"
{% endcollapse %}

## Advanced Relevance syntax

The previous sections provided you with the basic Relevance language features and the resources to explore all the available Relevance 
object types. This section introduces a more advanced syntax to help you understand the full capability of the Relevance language.

### Whose/It – Filtering a list

In the previous examples, you retrieved all the files of a folder, or a file with a specific file path, but you didn't select files with a 
certain characteristic. To do this, you must use a special syntax built into the Relevance Language using the keywords `whose` and `it`. 
First, let’s start with a general list:

{% evaluator %}
files of folder "/etc"
{% endevaluator %}

This result of this query is the list of all the files contained in the "/etc" folder. If, instead of getting all the files, you want to 
get the files whose filename ends with ".conf", you must use the `whose` clause. Let's see how:

{% evaluator %}
files whose (name of it ends with ".conf") of folder "/etc"
{% endevaluator %}

This clause iterates through all the files in the folder and returns only the files for which the `whose` clause returns `True`. In this 
example, `it` refers to each file in the "/etc" folder. If you are wondering how `ends with` is used, check out the reference page for 
{{'string' | linkType}}. You will see that `ends with` is also an operator, similar to `>=` used in the previous example.

You can learn more about the `whose` clause in this [guide page](/relevance/guide/basics/whose.html) and by watching the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwQADuUzhDY).

#### Practice with QNA

From the previous exercise, one way to check for the condition on the rpm package version is `(version of package "libxml2" of rpm) >= "2.9.1"`. 
However, this query assumes that the rpm package "libxml" exists on the system. In fact, the query returns Error if the package 
doesn't exist. Rewrite this query using the `exists` keyword and the `whose` clause so that the query returns `True` if both conditions 
are true, that is the package "libxml2" exists and its version is greater than or equal to "2.9.1". It has to return `False` otherwise, that is 
if the package doesn't exist, or its version is lower than "2.9.1".

{% evaluator %}

{% endevaluator %}

{% collapse "Show Answers" %}
exists packages "libxml2" whose (version of it >= "2.9.1") of rpm
{% endcollapse %}

### Using "it" without a "whose" 

The keyword `it` can also be used outside of a `whose` clause to refer to each single element of previous object. For instance,

{% qna %}
Q: it of files of folder "/etc"
{% endqna %}

is the same as

{% qna %}
Q: files of folder "/etc"
{% endqna %}

A common use of `it` is to retrieve multiple properties of an object. The following Relevance returns file name and size of the files:

{% evaluator %}
(name of it, size of it) of files of folder "/etc"
{% endevaluator %}

This query also makes use of a new object type called "tuple". A tuple is a compound type composed of two or more other types. 
Evaluate the relevance above and notice its returned type. For more information about tuples, read its [Guide](/relevance/guide/basics/tuples.html) 
and watch the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0V4Si849E).

### If/Then/Else

The Relevance langauge also supports [If/Then/Else](/relevance/guide/basics/if-then-else.html) clause to return different objects 
depending on whether a condition evaluates to `True` or `False`. The general syntax is:

````
if <conditional-expression> then <expression1> else <expression2>
````

Both `<expression1>` and `<expression2>` must have the same type, and `<conditional-expression>` must be a singular boolean. 
For more information, see the [If/Then/Else](/relevance/guide/basics/if-then-else.html) guide and watch the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRoZhvShPeY).

The following query returns the string "Yes" if the rpm package "libxml2" exists, and "No" otherwise:

{% qna %}
Q: if (exists packages "libxml2" of rpm) then "Yes" else "No"
A: Yes
{% endqna %}

#### Practice with QNA

Modify the previous query to return the package version if the package is available, or "No package" otherwise.

{% evaluator %}

{% endevaluator %}

{% collapse "Show Answers" %}
if (exists packages "libxml2" of rpm) then (version of it as string) of packages "libxml2" of rpm else "No package"
{% endcollapse %}

**Hint:** You might need to use the type casting to have the same object type for both `<expression1>` and `<expression2>`.
