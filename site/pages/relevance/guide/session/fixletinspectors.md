These Inspectors return information about Fixlet messages.

## BES Fixlet Field

In addition to the Relevance and Action fields, Fixlet messages and Tasks can contain various additional fields. 
If the content is developed in BDE, these fields might be specified by the Fixlet templates you use. 
Depending on the site or the template, fields might have different interpretations.
Field names and their meanings are variable and context-specific.
