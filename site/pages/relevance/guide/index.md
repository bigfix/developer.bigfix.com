# Guides

{% section %}

The relevance guides on this site provide you with self-lead training on the relevance language.

It is divided in three different parts:

* Click [Basics](/relevance/guide/basics/) to access the part describing the syntaxes and the constructs that are common to both languages.
* Click [Client](/relevance/guide/client/) to access the part dedicated to the client relevance language.
* Click **Session** to access the part dedicated to the session relevance language.

**Note:** If you are new to the relevance language, first view the following video [Exploring the Relevance Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRoZhvShPeY).

## Useful tools

To follow along with these guides you will need to download and use either the Fixlet Debugger for Windows platforms or the QnA for other platforms.

### Fixlet Debugger

It is a graphical based relevance and action script tester and debugger and is available only on the Windows platform. It is installed automatically with the BigFix console. A shortcut is automatically added in the Windows start menu.

Click [here](http://support.bigfix.com/bes/release/) to download the Fixlet Debugger independently from the BigFix console installation.

### QnA

It is a terminal-like environment for non-Windows platforms and allows testing of relevance and action script expressions from a terminal session. 

Click [here](http://support.bigfix.com/bes/install/besclients-nonwindows.html) to download QnA for BigFix UNIX, Linux, and Mac clients.

You can find the QnA client for Mac OS in Utilities DMG.

The QnA client for Linux and other platforms is available with the BESClient executable in the installation package.
