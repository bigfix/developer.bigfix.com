title: The Relevance Language
---

{% section %}
The scope of the Relevance Language is to retrieve and manipulate information by means of *Inspectors*. 

<p>There are two types of relevance language:

<dl>
  <dt>[Client Relevance Language](/relevance/guide/client)</dt>
  <dd>Used to interrogate locally the client system to retrieve information. Such information can be used to run analysis, to substitute variables in action scripts, <!--or, combined and correlated with other information in a Boolean expression, -->to determine applicability relevance and success criteria, and to generate automatic computer groups.</dd>
  
  <dt>[Session Relevance Language](/relevance/guide/session)</dt>
  <dd>Used to retrieve information from the BigFix database. This information can be displayed in custom dashboards or web reports, or used to integrate with external applications.</dd>
</dl>

Both types of relevance language share the same basic syntax and constructs, named [Core Inspectors](/relevance/guide/basics/)<!--, when building the expressions-->.</p>

<p>What is New in the BigFix Version 11 Inspectors:
<dl>
  <dt>[What is New in the BigFix Version 11 Inspectors](/relevance/whatisnew.html)</dt>
  <dd>A page where you can find listed the added or modified inspectors starting from BigFix Version 11.</dd>
 </dl>
.</p>
{% endsection %}

**Note:** If you are new to this language, first watch the introductory video [Exploring the Relevance Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fyGn3Inw1s ).


Navigate the Relevance subtree on the right to access the following resources:
<!-- a Tutorial, the User's Guides, the clickable list of inspectors grouped by themes, the list of inspectors and properties that you can search and filter (known as Inspectors Reference Library), and to access a Linux CentOS virtual sandbox where you can evaluate your relevance expressions for Linux.-->
<dl>
  <dt>[Guides](/relevance/guide/)</dt>
  <dd>A container of User's Guides for Client and Session Relevance Language, Core Inspectors, and error messages.</dd>
  
  <dt>[Tutorial](/relevance/tutorial.html)</dt>
  <dd>A tutorial lesson with exercises explaining how to build Relevance expressions using the most common inspectors.</dd>

  <dt>[Reference](/relevance/reference/)</dt>

  <dt>[Inspectors search](/relevance/search/)</dt>
  <dd>A page from where you can search and filter inspectors and their properties (known as Inspectors Reference Library).</dd>

  <dt>[Online evaluator](/relevance/evaluate/)</dt>
