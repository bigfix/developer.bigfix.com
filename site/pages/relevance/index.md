title: Relevance

{% section %}
This language is one of the bases of the BigFix product and its scope is to retrieve information.

There are two different types of relevance language:

<dl>
  <dt>**The client relevance language**</dt>
  <dd>Whose scope is to interrogate the local system to retrieve information. This information can be used to get the value of a specific property for running analysis and to manage variables substitution in action scripts, or combined and correlated with other information in a Boolean expression to determine applicability relevance, success criteria, and to generate automatic computer groups.</dd>

  <dt>**The session relevance language**</dt>

  <dd>Whose scope is to interrogate the BigFix database to retrieve information. This information can be displayed in dashboards, web reports or in customized user interfaces, or used to implement integration with external applications.</dd>
</dl>
{% endsection %}

Navigate this subtree to access the following resources and information:

<dl>
  <dt>**[Guides](/relevance/guide/)**</dt>
  <dd>Where you find an overview of the relevance language and the user's guides that you can navigate.</dd>

  <dt>**[Reference](/relevance/reference/)**</dt>
  <dd>Which contains the information about all the available inspectors with their creation methods and properties (aka Inspectors Reference).</dd>

  <dt>**[Inspector search](/relevance/search/)**</dt>
  <dd>Where you can search for the information about a specific inspector.</dd>

  <dt>**[Online evaluator](/relevance/evaluate/)**</dt>
  <dd>From where you can access an interactive sandbox where you can test your relevance expression.</dd>
</dl>
