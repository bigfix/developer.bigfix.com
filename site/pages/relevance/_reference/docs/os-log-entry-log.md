# type: os log entry log

The `OS Log Entry Log` inspector allows querying and filtering log entries from the local OS log store on macOS.

An object of this type provides most of the information otherwise available via the log entry types [listed here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/oslog?language=objc#Log-Entries).
