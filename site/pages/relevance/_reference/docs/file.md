# type: file

For each file in the file system, you can create a corresponding file object and inspect its properties. inspectors are also provided to look at version data of executable files.Note: File systems that do not maintain the creation or last accessed times will often return the last modification time when queried for the creation or last accessed times or files. Modification times are preserved when files are copied. Thus, it is not uncommon to see a file that appears to have been modified before it was created.

# alias of &lt;file&gt; : boolean

Returns `True` if the file is an alias for another file.

# aol error of &lt;file&gt; : string

# locked content of &lt;file&gt; : file content

Returns an object that can be used to search for a string in the specified file that might be locked because it is concurrently opened for writing by another application. 

You are supposed to use this inspector to access files that are only being appended to, such as log files, because the files can be changed while the inspector reads them. Otherwise the results can be unpredictable.

This inspector cannot read all kinds of *locked files*. It fails to open a file if another application has opened the file in an *exclusive mode*, that is, without allowing others to read the file.

The inspector does not override the access mode or the sharing flag specified to open the file by another application.
