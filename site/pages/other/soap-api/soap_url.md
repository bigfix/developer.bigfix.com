title: The SOAP URL
---

Interacting with Web Reports SOAP is different depending on what library you are using. However, there are two things that most libraries require: the location of the WSDL, and a location to send requests. The location of the Web Reports WSDL is:

```
http://example.com/webreports?wsdl
```

Where "example.com" is the URL of the Web Reports server. The location for posting requests is:

```
http://example.com/webreports/soap
```
