title: The BES SOAP API Tester
---

The BES SOAP Tester utility allows you to run session relevance against the Web Reports server of your choice. 
It is a read-only utility that uses the SOAP API. The utility only works with the HTTP protocol, not with the HTTPS protocol.

Click [this link](http://files.bigfix.me/bigfixsoap.zip) to download the SOAP API Tester and then double-click the EXE file to start the utility.

You are asked to provide the Web Reports URL, Username, and Password to start using the utility. 
Enter the Relevance query and then click **Run** to see the results of the query.
