title: The BigFix REST API
---

{% section %}

The REST API is the primary programming interface to the BigFix Server. It allows you to perform the majority of the tasks available in the BigFix console by using a set of standardized and operating system independent methods.
This API is also key if you want to automate activities, implement your custom BigFix user interface, or integrate with other applications.
