title: Customizing baselines
---

A baseline is a deployment container of Fixlets and tasks. You can use it to
apply a set of content at the same time to one or more targets. The contents
are applied according to the sequence specified in the baseline description.

This graphic shows the parts of the baseline that you can customize.

Click [Relevance](/relevance/) to access the information about the relevance 
language and navigate the content about Client Relevance Language and Core 
Inspectors.

**Note:** You can either create your baseline from scratch or make a copy of 
an existing baseline document and modify the copy. Do not edit baseline documents 
gathered from external sites to avoid misalignements.
