A task is a document that contains instructions that BigFix agents use on target
systems to run locally maintenance commands or configuration activities.

This graphic shows the parts of the task that you can customize.

For each part in the task structure, you see:

* On the right, an explanation of its role within the logic of the task.
* On the left, the language to use to create or modify that part. You can access the available information about that specific language by clicking the box or selecting the corresponding entry in the main toolbar.
