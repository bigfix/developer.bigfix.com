title: Manage Custom Content
---

The following graphic shows sample customizations that you can do to interact
with personalized data  available on the client system, the BigFix object to use
to implement them, and the languages involved.

![Manage Custom Content](/static/img/manage-custom-content.png)

The languages highlighted in the graphic operate in real time on the client computer
and their scope is to inspect  data, for the client relevance language, and to
run commands, for the action script language.

Click [Relevance](/relevance/) and [Action Script](/action-script/) to access 
the languages guides and the  references, and useful tools to create and test your 
custom queries and scripts locally [on the target client](/relevance/tools/fixlet_debugger.html) 
or using a [Linux CentOS interactive sandbox](/evaluate/).
<!-- , such as the Fixlet
Debugger and the interactive sandbox, the [Online Evaluator] (/evaluate/), that 
you can use to develop and test your custom solution. -->

If you own an IBM BigFix Lifecycle or an IBM BigFix Compliance version 9.5 Patch 2 
or later license, you can exercise your Client Relevance Language queries on the 
target clients also directly from the IBM WebUI using the IBM BigFix Query 
Application. For more information, click [IBM BigFix Query](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTK87_9.5.0/com.ibm.bigfix.webui.doc/WebUI/Users_Guide/c_bigfix_query.html). 

Select [Examples](/examples/) in the main toolbar and then the name
of the scenario shown in the graphic to  see the steps to run to implement it.
