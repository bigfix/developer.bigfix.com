title: Managing custom content
---

The following graphic shows sample customizations that you can do to interact
with personalized data  available on the client system, the BigFix object to use
to implement them, and the languages involved.

![Manage Custom Content](/static/img/manage-custom-content.png)

The languages highlighted in the graphic operate in real time on the client computer
and their scope is to inspect  data, for the client relevance language, and to
run commands, for the action script language.

Click [Relevance](/relevance/) and [Action Script](/action-script/) to access
the languages guides and the  references, and useful tools to create and test your
custom queries and scripts locally with the Fixlet Debugger <!-- [on the target client](/relevance/tools/fixlet_debugger.html) --> 
or using a [Linux CentOS interactive sandbox](/relevance/evaluate/).
<!-- , such as the Fixlet
Debugger and the interactive sandbox, the [Online Evaluator] (/evaluate/), that 
you can use to develop and test your custom solution. -->

If you own a BigFix Lifecycle or a BigFix Compliance license, you can exercise your Client Relevance Language queries on the target clients also directly from the WebUI using the BigFix Query Application. For more information, click [Get Started with BigFix Query](https://help.hcl-software.com/bigfix/11.0/webui/WebUI/Users_Guide/c_bigfix_query.html).

Select [Examples](/examples/) in the main toolbar and then the name
of the scenario shown in the graphic to  see the steps to run to implement it.
