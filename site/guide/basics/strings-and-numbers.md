# Strings and Numbers

The basic building blocks of the relevance language are numbers, strings and the expressions
that combine them.

The "Q:" is the relevance query that is being run and the "A:" is the answer to our query. We will discover that queries can be complex and the answers to a query can be of any type, but more on that soon!

## Strings and Integers

Strings are sets of characters (a-z,0-9,!@#$) that are surrounded by quotes. To start, we will write a relevance string that outputs, "hello world"
{{#example}}
Q: "hello world"
A: hello world
{{/example}}

Strings aren’t the only primitives:

Integers are numbers (0-9) without a decimal place. Integers are not wrapped in quotes. We can write a relevance query whose answer is a number
{{#example}}
Q: 6000
A: 6000
{{/example}}

## Simple Operators
The normal operators you'd expect to be able to use with numbers work in the Relevance Language. Addition and multiplication are valid operations for integers so this works.

{{#example}}
Q: (8+3)*6
A: 66
{{/example}}

However, plus and times are not valid operations for strings so this does not work.

The other thing we will notice right away is that you can't mix strings and integers:
{{#example}}
Q: ("8" + "3") * 6
E: The operator "times" is not defined.
{{/example}}

Besides, how would you multiply two strings together anyway?! You might be asking, why can't I add strings together?

{{#example}}
Q: "8" + "3"
E: The operator "plus" is not defined.
{{/example}}

The answer is that combining strings is not called, "adding", it's "concatenating" and the operator is, "&"
{{#example}}
Q: "8" & "3"
A: 83
{{/example}}


## String Operations
{{#example}}
Q: substrings separated by "-" of "an-over-hyphenated-string"
A: an
A: over
A: hyphenated
A: string
{{/example}}

Note in the example above that four values were returned, not just one. This
output is typical of a plural inspector like `substrings`. You can filter this
list with a `whose` statement:

{{#example}}
Q: (substrings separated by " " of "who observed what happened, when and where?") whose (it contains "w")
A: who
A: what
A: when
A: where?
{{/example}}

This example shows two clauses in parentheses. The first parenthetical clause
creates a list of words (substrings separated by a space). This `whose` clause
contains the primary keyword `it` (discussed in greater detail below), that can
stand in for another object – in this case, `it` stands in for each of the
individual words, and the expression returns just those words that contain the
letter 'w'. How many of these substrings are there?

{{#example}}
Q: number of (substrings separated by " " of "who observed what happened, when and where?") whose (it contains "w")
A: 4 
{{/example}}

This expression shows how you can count up the number of items returned and
filtered from a plural inspector. As these examples show, you can get either
singular or plural items back from a Relevance expression. What about no items
at all? That's a subject for the next section.

## Escaping

Literal strings like this are parsed for one special character: the percent
sign. This is an escape character that encodes for other, non-printable
characters, specifically control characters and delete. When a percent sign is
found, the encoding expects the next two characters to be hex digits producing a
one-byte hex value. That hex value is then added to the internal representation
of the string, allowing you incorporate otherwise unavailable characters into a
string. Since the percent is used as the escape key, to actually get a percent
into a string you must use `%25`, the hex value of percent. To convert back to
an escaped string for output, characters with a hex value less than `0x20`,
greater than `0x7E` or equal to `0x25` are printed as escaped characters, e.g.
`%25`.
