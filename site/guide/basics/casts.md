Values can be converted into other types, making it easy to create, concatenate
and combine inspectors into complex expressions.

Converts (casts) a string into a date type.

The Relevance Debugger casts values to strings in order to print them. If an
object does not result in a string, the debugger uses the `as string` method of
the object to turn it into a string. If the object canâ€™t be cast as a string, an
error message is displayed.
