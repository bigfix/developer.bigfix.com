# Introduction

The relevance guides on this site exist to provide self-lead training on the relevance language.

To follow along with these guides you will need to obtain and utilize either the Fixlet Debugger for Windows or QnA for other platforms.

## Fixlet Debugger

The Fixlet Debugger is a graphical based relevance and actionscript tester and debugger and is available only on the Windows platform and is installed automatically when the IBM Endpoint Manager console is installed. A shortcut is automatically placed in the start menu.

The Fixlet Debugger can be independently obtained from the BigFix download center here: http://support.bigfix.com/bes/release/

## QnA

QnA is a terminal-like environment for non-Windows platforms and allows testing of relevance and actionscript from a terminal session. QnA is installed alongside the Besclient in the agent installation folder. QnA can also be obtained from the BigFix Unix, Linux, and Mac Clients page here: http://support.bigfix.com/bes/install/besclients-nonwindows.html

For Mac OS the QnA client will be in a Utilities DMG
For Linux and other platforms the QnA client will be alongside the BESClient executable in the installation package.
