# type: environment variable

Every variable defined by the environment has both a name and a value. Both names and values are treated as strings.

# name of &lt;environment variable&gt; : string

Returns the name of the variable.

# value of &lt;environment variable&gt; : string

Returns the value of the variable.

# &lt;environment variable&gt; as string : string

Casting the variable as a string yields a string containing the variable name and the value of the variable separated by &amp;#39; = &amp;#39;.
