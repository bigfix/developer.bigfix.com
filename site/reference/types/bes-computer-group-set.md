# type: bes computer group set

The &lt;bes computer group set&gt; inspectors convert an iterated list of computer groups into a set, which allows you to perform intersections, unions and other mathematical operations on them.

# element of &lt;bes computer group set&gt; : bes computer group

Returns the unique elements of the specified &lt;bes computer group set&gt;, removing duplicates and sorting by value.

# intersection of &lt;bes computer group set&gt; : bes computer group set

Returns the intersection of multiple BES computer group sets. The arguments to this inspector are typically plural values or iterations, but you can also compose such a set by separating singlet values with semicolons.

# size of &lt;bes computer group set&gt; : integer

Returns the number of unique BES Computer Groups in the specified set.

# union of &lt;bes computer group set&gt; : bes computer group set

Returns the union of multiple BES computer group sets. The arguments to this inspector are typically plural values or iterations, but you can also compose such a set by separating singlet values with semicolons.

# &lt;bes computer group set&gt; as xml : utf8 string

Converts the specified set of BES computer groups to XML format, for submission to the EvaluateRelevance API used by the BES Console and Web Reports.
