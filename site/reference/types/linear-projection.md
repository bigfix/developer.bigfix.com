# linear projection

The &lt;linear projection&gt; inspectors return statistical correlation information about the linearity of specific aggregated properties.

# correlation coefficient of &lt;linear projection&gt;

Returns a floating-point number between -1 and 1, representing how well a linear projection fits the data.

# extrapolation &lt;time&gt; of &lt;linear projection&gt;

Returns the projected value at the specified time, assuming a linear projection.

# rate of &lt;linear projection&gt;

Returns the slope of the linear projection. Multiply this by a time interval to compute the projected growth over that period.
