# type: bes user set

The &amp;lt;bes user set&amp;gt; inspectors iterate over the current set of BES users and package them as a mathematical set, suitable for further set manipulation.

# element of &lt;bes user set&gt; : bes user

Returns the unique elements of the specified &amp;lt;bes user set&amp;gt;, removing duplicates and sorting by value.

# intersection of &lt;bes user set&gt; : bes user set

Returns the intersection of multiple BES User sets. The arguments to this inspector are typically plural values or iterations, but you can also compose such a set by separating singlet values with semicolons.

# size of &lt;bes user set&gt; : integer

Returns the number of unique BES Users in the specified set.

# union of &lt;bes user set&gt; : bes user set

Returns the union of multiple BES User sets. The arguments to this inspector are typically plural values or iterations, but you can also compose such a set by separating singlet values with semicolons.
