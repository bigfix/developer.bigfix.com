# string

Strings are typically core objects, but some string inspectors may be client-specific. Note: A string literal is written within double quotes. Special characters must be inserted by using the percent sign followed by 2 hex digits. Special characters include those characters with ASCII codes less than the &#39;space&#39; character (hex 20) or greater than &#39;tilde&#39; character (hex 7f) as well as the percent character itself (25 hex). For example, to create a string containing a null character and a percent character use &quot;a null is %00, the percent itself is %25&quot;. Conversion to upper and lower case is also provided. String works in combination with the string position and substring data types. A string position is a point within a string. It can be compared to an integer, but it also acts as a pointer within a string so that the preceding and following text can be extracted. A substring is a part of a larger string. All operations allowed on a string can be performed on a substring. There are two substrings &quot;be&quot; in the string &quot;To be or not to be&quot;. The substrings only differ in their positions within the string.
